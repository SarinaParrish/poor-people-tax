🧠 Overview

In 2003, nearly 4 in 10 young Americans played the lottery.
By 2016, that number fell — but the spirit of speculation simply went digital.

Crypto arrived as a shinier version of the same gamble:
buy in, believe, maybe win big.

The Poor People Tax contrasts the decline of lottery play with the rise of crypto ownership,
and ends by revealing how wealth concentration remains just as steep online as it was off.
